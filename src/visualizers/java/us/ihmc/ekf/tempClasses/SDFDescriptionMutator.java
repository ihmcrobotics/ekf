/**
 * This interface defines an API for tweaking the properties of elements in .SDF files
 * at runtime. Functionally, it is equivalent to performing a hand-edit on an SDF file,
 * but does not require us to maintain a manual workflow for hand-editing when we regenerate
 * .sdf files that originate as Xacro templates.
 *
 * This interface does not currently define a way for making additions to a model; it simply
 * allows for modifications to the stock elements in the .xml on disk.
 *
 * As an .SDF can contain multiple models (vehicles, robots, obstacles, etc.) all of the mutation
 * methods take in a model name argument, passing on which model the joint or link belongs to.
 * This information should be checked by implementing classes to be future-proof for loading of
 * multi-model simulation descriptions.
